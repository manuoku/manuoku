Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working in [![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-007396?style=plastic&logo=Java&logoColor=white)](https://www.java.com/) and [![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Spring-74C651?style=plastic&logo=Spring&logoColor=white)](https://spring.io/) environments.

However, I'm always eager to dive into new technologies and domains when needed for the team. ðŸ’¡
